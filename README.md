# Wireless-Transmission-Signal-Simulate-System
This project was submitted to Question C, "Wireless Transmission Signal Simulate System", for the 2024 JiangSu Undergraduate Electronic Design Contest.  
Because the timing overlapped with the CICC, We wasn't well-prepared, but We were fortunate enough to win second prize.
The system mainly consists of 2 FPGAs (Altera MAX10), 1 STM32F407 (VGT6), 1 Serial port screen, 4 DACs (AD9708), 2 multipliers (AD835), 2 AGCs (AD8367), 1 attenuator, 1 adder, and several high-speed followers.   
This is for reference only.
